*The spec, a map, so clear and bright,*

*To guide the coder through the night.*

*No tangled paths or features stray,*

*Just building in a focused way.*

*With every function, class, and line,*

*The blueprint's vision starts to shine.*

*So raise a glass to well-laid plans,*

*And happy code in skillful hands.*


# The Code Spec Blueprint

This repository contains a single-page, static website about a software development concept called "The Code Spec Blueprint."

## Purpose

The website explains the benefits of using a "Code Specification" as a single source of truth in a software project to connect design, requirements, and code.

## Technology

It's built with plain HTML.

## Features

The page is a scrollable journey that details:
*   The "problem" of disconnected development documents.
*   The "solution" of a unified code spec.
*   An interactive chart showing the "benefits" of this approach.

## Infrastructure

The project is set up for **Firebase Hosting** and includes a simple `http-server` for local development.
